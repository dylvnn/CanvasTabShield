## How It Works

### Tab Switching Protection
The extension overrides key browser APIs that Canvas uses to detect tab switching:
- `document.visibilityState`
- `document.hidden`
- `Document.prototype.hasFocus`
- Event listeners for `focus`, `blur`, `visibilitychange`, etc.

### AI Trojan Horse Protection
Automatically detects and removes hidden tracking elements:
- Monitors for `span[aria-hidden="true"]` elements
- Targets specific Canvas content wrappers
- Uses MutationObserver for dynamic content
- Safely removes or hides tracking elements
